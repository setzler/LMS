The data preparation is performed by the "LMS_data" data replication pack available to internal researchers on the SOI server. It includes a README file which explains how to prepare the software environment and source the data construction script, which is written in R. See our Data Availability Statement for details on accessing this data. Once access is obtained, email the SOI administrator to request the replication pack. Run time for this step is approximately 10 hours.
